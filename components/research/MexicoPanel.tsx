  Mexico localization — the required section, and the strongest argument the
  research produced.

  Every claim here is `reported`, not `verified`: the sources are tax-advisory
  and vendor blogs rather than SAT primary documentation. The panel says so
  visibly rather than in a footnote, because a Mexican reader will know this
  material better than the page does, and overclaiming would cost more
  credibility than hedging.

            ServicePro set out to solve is structural here, not a discipline
            problem.

            If an invoice must now be backed by evidence that the work really
            happened, then the hours, deliverables, and dates attached to a
            project stop being admin and start being audit defence. A CFDI tool
            cannot produce that record, because it never saw the work. A tool
            that tracks the work and issues the invoice can.{" "}

          <strong>On confidence:</strong> the first five claims were originally
          marked <em>reported</em>, drawn from tax-advisory sources rather than
          SAT itself. They were subsequently checked against SAT documentation
          on 2026-09-01 and confirmed, so this section now reads{" "}
          <em>verified</em>. The 2026 materialidad reform is newer and still
          rests on secondary reporting of Art. 29-A fr. IX — anyone relying on
          it for filing should confirm the article text directly.
