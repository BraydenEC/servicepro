# Build Discipline Packet

*Committed before any Week 2 code was written (Gate 1).*

## Problem — What user problem is this feature solving?

The first two weeks built a product on an assumption: that freelancers lose money and miss deadlines because their project, time, and invoice data lives in three disconnected places. **Nobody had checked whether that was true.**

That is the user's problem before it is the builder's. A freelancer considering ServicePro has no way to know whether it addresses a real gap or duplicates what Harvest already does for $12 a month.

There is a sharper version specific to this market. A Mexican freelancer cannot settle a client invoice with a PDF — Mexican tax law requires a CFDI issued through the SAT. If the global tools do not do that, a Mexican freelancer using one is *already* running two systems, and the fragmentation ServicePro claims to solve is worse here than the product's own framing assumed.

This module tests the premise instead of assuming it — including the possibility that it is wrong.

## User — Who will use it?

Two audiences. **The builder**, deciding whether to keep going and where to aim — a research page that only confirms the plan is worthless. And **a prospective user or evaluator** asking the reasonable question: why does this exist when Harvest, Bonsai, and FreshBooks already do? The page answers with evidence somebody else can check.

## Success — What must work by the end of the week?

`/research` loads in production with five global benchmarks, Mexico localization, at least eight competitors and substitutes, client-side filter and search, a likelihood × impact risk map, an intake form saving to Supabase, a dashboard widget, and a stated confidence level on every claim.

**Result: achieved.** Live at HTTP 200 in 1.20s. Eleven entries, 28 confidence badges, nine sources all resolving.

## UX Concept

Wireframe produced during planning: single scrolling page — header, headline finding, benchmark cards, Mexico panel, filterable competitor table, risk map, intake, saved records.

*(Insert wireframe.svg here)*

**Implementation note.** This page reuses the dashboard's visual language but is a *document* rather than an instrument panel: longer prose, wider measure, and one new element type — a verification badge on every factual row.

Three divergences from the wireframe:

1. **The headline finding is computed, not written.** "Of 11 surveyed, 9 track projects, 4 issue CFDI, 0 do both" is derived from the dataset at render time, so the claim cannot drift out of sync with the table beneath it.
2. **Substitutes were moved into the main table** rather than a separate section. The honest competitive picture is that the incumbent is a spreadsheet; segregating substitutes would flatter the analysis.
3. **The risk map gained a ranked list beneath it.** A dot in a grid shows position but not reasoning, and the reasoning is the argument.

## Scope Cut — What looked nice but will not be built this week?

| Cut | Why |
|---|---|
| Live competitor pricing via API | No such API exists across these vendors; scraping breaks silently and produces exactly the fake confidence this module prevents |
| Automated source re-verification | A `verified_on` date the reader can judge beats a freshness check that quietly fails |
| Charts beyond the risk map | A bar chart of pricing adds decoration, not argument |
| Editing or deleting saved records | Read and create only |
| A survey of freelancers | One real conversation honestly reported beats a survey with n=4 |
| **Auto-generating competitor entries from a model** | **Deliberately rejected.** The model structures a note supplied to it; it does not invent market facts |

## Product Spec — Requirements and acceptance criteria

## Architecture — Frontend, backend, database, data flow

**Frontend:** Next.js 16 App Router, Tailwind v4, on Vercel. **Backend:** two Route Handlers, server-only. **Database:** Supabase Postgres, `research_records`.

**Data flow.** `/research` is a Server Component rendering curated seed data from the repository plus saved records from Supabase. The competitor table receives the dataset as props and filters it in the browser. The intake form posts a note to `/api/research/extract`, which calls Claude with a versioned prompt and falls back to a deterministic extractor on any failure; the response always names which path produced it. Saving posts to `/api/research/save`, which validates and inserts.

**Why seed data lives in the repository.** The research *is* the deliverable. Version control means every claim has a commit history, the page is never empty for a reader, and a pricing change appears as a reviewable diff.

**The architectural first.** `CompetitorTable` is this project's first Client Component — Weeks 0 and 1 were entirely server-rendered. Filtering must feel instant, and a round trip per keystroke for eleven rows would be absurd.

**Four independent checks against fabrication:** the prompt forbids inventing a URL; the code discards any returned URL absent from the source note; the API route refuses `verified` with no source; and a Postgres `CHECK` enforces the same rule at rest. `source_url` stays **nullable** on purpose — `NOT NULL` would push people to paste a plausible link to satisfy the constraint, which is fabrication with extra steps.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why, and what was rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Research verification | WebFetch against primary sources | *Rejected: model memory* — the training cutoff predates this assignment, so every figure would be stale and confident |
| Filtering | Client Component + `useMemo` | *Rejected: server-side filtering* — a round trip per keystroke for 11 rows |
| Risk map | CSS grid + inline SVG | *Rejected: Recharts / Chart.js* — a dependency for one 3×3 grid |
| Extraction | Reuses the Week 1 extractor and fallback | The module compounds rather than sitting beside the last one |
| Database | Supabase Postgres | Third table in the existing project |

**Net new third-party dependencies: zero**, for the third week running.

## DevOps

**GitHub:** 34 commits on `main`, auto-deploying. **Vercel:** existing project, **no new environment variables** — `/research` uses the Supabase and Anthropic keys already configured. **Supabase:** `research_records` added as a re-runnable migration alongside the Week 0 and Week 1 schemas. **Deployment plan:** shipped at Phase 3, as soon as the page rendered, before the remaining features — consistent with Weeks 0 and 1 and for the same reason.

## Test Plan

Six software tests executed with raw output, plus the required human validation conversation. Summary:

| # | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Every cited source resolves** | ✅ 9/9 return HTTP 200 |
| 2 | Every claim carries a confidence level | ✅ 28 badges, 9 unsourced markers |
| 3 | Filter and search compose as intersection | ✅ **17/17 assertions executed** via `npm run test:filters` |
| 4 | Extractor refuses to overstate confidence | ✅ Opinion → `estimated`, no invented citation |
| 5 | Validation and the honesty constraint | ✅ 4 rejections + verified-without-source refused |
| 6 | Degrades with no model key | ✅ Falls back, marks `reported` not `verified` |
| — | **Human validation conversation** | ⬅️ **OUTSTANDING** |

**Test 1 is the one that matters.** It is the only automated check capable of catching a fabricated citation — a source that does not exist cannot return 200.

## Coding Agent Prompt

> Build a `/research` page for the existing ServicePro Next.js 16 app. It presents market research as evidence: five global benchmark cards, a Mexico localization section covering the CFDI/SAT invoicing requirement, and a table of at least eight competitors and substitutes with client-side filter and search. Add a likelihood × impact risk map rendered with CSS grid and inline SVG — no chart library. Include an intake form that converts a research note into a structured record via the Week 1 extractor, with the same deterministic fallback, saving to a new Supabase `research_records` table. Add a summary widget to the dashboard.
>
> Every factual claim must carry a source URL and the date it was checked, and must render its confidence level; `source_url` is nullable so an unsourced claim is visibly unsourced rather than silently presented as fact. Do not generate market figures from memory — verify each one against a primary source and cite it, or mark it unverified.

# The Finding

**Of 11 products and substitutes surveyed, 9 track projects, 4 can issue a Mexican CFDI, and 0 do both.**

The gap holds from both directions. Five global tools — Harvest, Bonsai, FreshBooks, Toggl, Clockify — offer projects and time tracking with PDF invoices and **no mention of CFDI on any pricing page**. Three Mexican tools — Alegra, Facturama, gigstack — issue CFDI with timbrado and have **no project or time tracking**, which gigstack states explicitly about itself.

Toggl phrases the gap in its own feature list: *"Generate and download PDF invoices."* In Mexico that is a picture of a fiscal document, not a fiscal document.

A Mexican freelancer therefore runs two systems by **legal necessity, not disorganization** — and CFDI requires a government-authorized PAC rather than a better invoice template, which is why the gap has persisted and why it is hard to cross.

⚠️ **Confidence note:** the Mexican tax claims are marked `reported`, not `verified` — sourced from tax-advisory and vendor material rather than SAT primary documentation, and flagged for spot-check against SAT before submission.

# Iteration Log — Selected Entries

Ten iterations were recorded. The four most significant:

## 1. The schema was designed against the tool building it

A research module asks for exactly the material a language model invents fluently, and no test catches a fabricated statistic by reading it. So verification became a first-class field before any code existed: `source_url`, `verified_on`, and a required `confidence` enum.

**The rejection worth naming:** making `source_url` `NOT NULL`. It looks responsible and is worse — a required source field pushes people to paste a plausible link to satisfy the constraint, which is fabrication with extra steps. The schema makes weakness visible instead.

## 2. The research changed the problem statement

Weeks 0 and 1 framed fragmentation as a discipline problem — freelancers being disorganized. The research showed no surveyed product does both halves, and that CFDI requires a PAC integration rather than a template. **The problem is structural, not behavioral.** That is a better problem to be solving and it was invisible before the research.

## 3. Two corrections against the analysis's own interest

FreshBooks advertises 90% off; recording $2.30 as "the price" would have been technically true and materially false, so list price is recorded. Harvest's free tier was reclassified from a freemium on-ramp to a **genuine competitor** — free forever for one seat is a complete product for a solo freelancer. Both make the argument less flattering and more honest.

## 4. A test reported a catastrophic false failure

The source-resolution check first reported every citation broken. The data was fine; zsh does not word-split unquoted parameter expansions, so the entire URL list went to `curl` as a single argument. The instinct was to suspect the sources.

**A test that reports a false failure is as dangerous as one that reports a false pass** — both mean the harness is what is being read, not the code. Rewritten with an explicit read loop; 9/9 now resolve.
