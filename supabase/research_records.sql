-- HOW TO RUN
--   Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run
--   Safe to re-run: drops and recreates the table.
--
-- Additive. Does not touch `projects` (Week 0) or `core_outputs` (Week 1).

drop table if exists public.research_records;

create table public.research_records (
  id             uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),

  -- The original note, kept verbatim so any record can be audited against
  -- what was actually written, or re-run under a newer prompt.
  raw_input      text        not null,

  title          text        not null,
  summary        text        not null,

  -- THE POINT OF THIS TABLE.
  --
  -- source_url is deliberately NULLABLE and confidence is NOT NULL. Together
  -- they make an unsourced claim representable but *visible*: a record can be
  -- saved without a source, and it will carry confidence = 'estimated' and
  -- render as unsourced in the UI.
  --
  -- Making source_url NOT NULL would be worse, not better — it would push
  -- people to paste a plausible-looking link to satisfy the constraint, which
  -- is fabrication with extra steps. The schema surfaces the weakness instead
  -- of forbidding it.
  source_url     text,
  verified_on    date,
  confidence     text        not null
                 check (confidence in ('verified', 'reported', 'estimated')),

  -- A claim cannot be 'verified' without a source to verify it against.
  -- This is the one honesty rule worth enforcing in the database rather than
  -- the application, because it is about the meaning of the data itself.
  constraint verified_requires_source
    check (confidence <> 'verified' or source_url is not null),

  -- Provenance, same discipline as core_outputs.

-- Row Level Security
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Read is public; writes go through the server route, which uses the same anon
-- key, so an insert policy is required for saving to work at all. Scoped to
-- insert only — no update, no delete.

alter table public.research_records enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "Public read access" on public.research_records;
create policy "Public read access"
  on public.research_records for select
  to anon, authenticated using (true);

drop policy if exists "Public insert access" on public.research_records;
create policy "Public insert access"
  on public.research_records for insert
  to anon, authenticated with check (true);

-- Verify
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Expect 0 rows and the constraint to reject a verified claim with no source.
