  One schema, three consumers: the Anthropic structured-output format, the

  Defining it once means the model path and the heuristic path cannot drift
  into producing different shapes — which matters because the UI renders both
  through the same card.

  Nullable fields are a deliberate design decision, not laziness.

  A brief that never mentions an hourly rate should produce `hourly_rate: null`
  and say so in the confidence note. The alternative — letting the model pick a
  plausible-looking number — produces a record that is confidently wrong, and
  the user has no way to tell which figures were read and which were invented.
  For a tool whose entire job is transcription, inventing data is the worst
  possible failure.
