  Curated research seed data.

  Every figure here was fetched from the source's own page on 2026-08-31 —
  not recalled, not estimated, not taken from a comparison article. Full
  write-up with methodology: docs/week2/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md

  Three rules this file follows, and any future edit must too:

  1. LIST PRICE, NOT PROMOTIONAL PRICE. FreshBooks currently advertises 90%
     off for three months. Recording $2.30 as "the price" would be exactly the
     misleading precision this module exists to prevent.

  2. CONFIDENCE IS HONEST, NOT UNIFORM. Vendor pricing is `verified`. Mexican
     tax law is `reported`, because the sources are advisory blogs rather than
     SAT primary documentation. Behavioural claims about substitutes are
     `estimated`, because they are judgment.

  3. NO FIGURE WITHOUT A SOURCE. If it cannot be cited it ships marked
     unverified rather than dressed up with a plausible citation.
