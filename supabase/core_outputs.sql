-- HOW TO RUN
--   Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run
--   Safe to re-run: drops and recreates the table.
--
-- This is additive. It does not touch the Week 0 `projects` table.

  -- extraction after the fact, or to re-run it against a newer prompt.

  -- the extractor to invent values, which is the one failure mode this
  -- module exists to avoid.

-- Row Level Security
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Unlike `projects`, this table is WRITTEN from the app, so it needs an insert
-- policy as well as a read policy. There is still no authentication this
-- sprint, so both apply to `anon`.
--
-- This is a deliberate, documented tradeoff: a public insert policy means
-- anyone holding the anon key can add rows. Acceptable for a single-user
-- coursework demo with no sensitive data; it would NOT be acceptable in a real
-- product, where these policies would be scoped to auth.uid().
--
-- Update and delete are intentionally omitted. Saved outputs are an append-only
-- audit trail, so the public key cannot rewrite or erase history.

drop policy if exists "Public read access" on public.core_outputs;
