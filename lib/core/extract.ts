  Extraction orchestration.

  Same null-safe pattern proven in Week 0: a missing key is a supported state,
  not an error. Constructing the SDK client at module scope would throw during
  `next build` when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is absent — failing the deployment before
  the fallback could ever run.

  One deliberate difference from Week 0: the result always names which path
  produced it. Week 0's fallback was invisible, and production silently served
  mock data for six deployments. Degradation here is observable by design.
